Data and Methodology
The input data consists of features related to visceral fat levels. The data is preprocessed and fed into each of the aforementioned algorithms. The performance of each model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in determining the most effective algorithm for classifying visceral fat levels into the three risk categories.
